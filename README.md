# Marketing Prompts for Founders

A complete marketing system for solo technical founders, built as Claude Code skills and commands. Sourced from 300+ curated resources, deduplicated and distilled into actionable playbooks.

Based on [Marketing-for-Founders](https://github.com/EdoStra/Marketing-for-Founders) by EdoStra.

## What This Is

19 knowledge files, 16 interactive commands, and a journey orchestrator that tells you exactly what marketing to do next based on where you are.

**Not a reading list.** Every command asks about YOUR product, walks you through a methodology, and generates real artifacts — emails, landing page copy, SEO strategies, launch plans — customized to your situation.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marketing-prompts-for-founders.git
```

### 2. Install into Claude Code

Option A — Symlink (recommended, stays in sync):
```bash
# Link knowledge, skills, and commands into your Claude config
ln -s $(pwd)/knowledge ~/.claude/knowledge/_marketing
ln -s $(pwd)/skills/marketing.md ~/.claude/skills/marketing.md
ln -s $(pwd)/commands/marketing ~/.claude/commands/marketing
```

Option B — Copy:
```bash
cp -r knowledge/ ~/.claude/knowledge/_marketing/
cp skills/marketing.md ~/.claude/skills/marketing.md
cp -r commands/marketing/ ~/.claude/commands/marketing/
```

### 3. Start your journey

```
/marketing:journey
```

It asks where you are and tells you what to do next.

## How It Works

```
You (solo founder)
    │
    ▼
/marketing:journey ──→ "You're at stage D, do these 2 things"
    │
    ▼
/marketing:outreach ──→ asks about your product
    │                    walks you through ICP → triggers → emails
    │                    generates 3 cold email templates
    │                    designs outreach sequence
    │
    ▼
Real artifacts you can use today
```

Each command:
1. **Asks** 3-5 questions about your specific product
2. **Walks** you through the methodology step by step
3. **Generates** customized artifacts (copy, emails, plans)
4. **Points** you to what to do next
